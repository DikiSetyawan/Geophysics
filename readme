Welcome to the Gravity Processing Repository!

This repository contains code for processing gravity data, including data preprocessing, Bouguer correction, residual and regional calculation, and map creation.

## Table of Contents

1. [Data Preprocessing](#data-preprocessing)
2. [Bouguer Correction](#bouguer-correction)
3. [Residual and Regional Calculation](#residual-and-regional-calculation)
4. [Map Creation](#map-creation)

this repository is for processing gravity data, but the processing is not yet accurate, and i might worked on it soon.

for the next thing to do is to add 2d and 3d inverse modelling
and adding ui to make it more interactive, maybe using tkinter or streamlit.
